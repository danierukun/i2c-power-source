# I2C Power Source
Power source controlled exclusively with I2C.

## Features
- I2C control interface
- Variable power supply
- Designed for 1A@24v max power output
- High impedance external MCU reset
- In circuit serial programming (ICSP) support

## Purpose
This board was originally part of a digitally controlled lab bench power supply.
After some thought this board was split from the main design. It is meant as a simple I2c-controlled power supply.
This board can be coupled with the pic control board to make a n-channel power source.
